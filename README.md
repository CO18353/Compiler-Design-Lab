1. To check whether a string is recognized by a finite automata.
2.  To construct the transition table for a particular type of language and check whether the string is accepted by that language.
3.  To convert Non Deterministic Finite Automata with Null (NFA-^) to Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA). 
4.  To identify whether the given line is a comment and to print the type of comment along with its length. Also print the total number of comments.
5.  A  simple Lexical Analyser.
6.  A program for deriving a string from a given CFG and printing its parse tree.
7.  A program to implement a Bottom-Up Parsing technique (Shift Reduce Parsing).
8.  A program to implement a Top-Down Parsing technique (Predictive Parsing).
9.  A program to implement SLR Parser.
10. A program to implement CLR Parser.
11. A program to implement LALR Parser.
